# Who is this book for?

Explains why *Model to Meaning* targets analysts who must convert complex model outputs into narratives stakeholders can trust. It distinguishes between novices seeking a reusable workflow and experienced researchers who need to standardize how they turn fitted-model parameters into intuitive estimands. The chapter sketches the progression of the book—Part I (goals + framework), Part II (predictions/comparisons/slopes/tests), and Part III (case studies)—so readers know where to find conceptual vs. applied material.

The "Software" section motivates the marginaleffects packages for R and Python. It lists the three flagship function families (`predictions()`, `comparisons()`, `slopes()` and their `avg_*` shortcuts), explains why post-estimation work should happen through one API instead of ad hoc code, and notes compatibility with 100+ model classes (GLM, GAM, mixed, Bayesian, ML wrappers). Tables such as `tbl-marginaleffects_functions` map each analytical goal to a concrete function.

In "Documentation" the chapter documents how to access help: `?predictions` / `help(predictions)`, the website tutorials, and the `get_dataset()` helper that exposes all example datasets from both the marginaleffects archive and Rdatasets. Sample snippets show how to fetch data (e.g., Titanic, Stat2Data) and how to open browser docs with `docs=TRUE`. This sets the expectation that every subsequent example can be reproduced by calling `get_dataset()` with the name referenced in the text or by downloading `https://marginaleffects.com/data/model_to_meaning.zip`.
