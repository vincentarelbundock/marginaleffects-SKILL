# Hypothesis and equivalence tests

Details how to test any quantity produced by marginaleffects, not just raw coefficients. It formalizes Wald-style null tests with statistic `Z = (h(\hat\theta) - H_0) / SE`, explaining how `h()` can be a parameter, prediction, comparison, or slope. Using the Thornton HIV incentive dataset, it demonstrates: fitting `lm(outcome ~ agecat - 1)`, extracting age-group means, and rejecting alternative null values (e.g., 0.5 rather than 0) with `hypotheses(mod, hypothesis = 0.5)`. It shows how to compute the same tests manually via `pnorm` to reinforce the mechanics.

The chapter then presents equivalence testing (two one-sided tests / TOST) to argue practical sameness. It describes how to supply intervals (e.g., `hypotheses(mod, equivalence = c(-0.02, 0.02))`) and interpret cases where both null rejection and equivalence rejection indicate statistically detectable but practically negligible effects. Examples include comparing age categories, testing if subgroup differences fall below policy-relevant thresholds, and stacking multiple hypotheses to run joint tests.

Key functions and options: `hypotheses()` to define constraints in plain math syntax, `avg_predictions()` / `avg_comparisons()` as inputs to `hypotheses()`, `variables=` + `newdata=` to target subgroup differences, and `vcov=` to request robust or clustered SEs before testing. Emphasis is placed on articulating meaningful `H_0` values and on reporting both statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals) and substantive significance (effect magnitudes relative to domain benchmarks).
